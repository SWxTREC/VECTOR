    <h1>SESAM</h1>
    <p>
        The Semi-Empirical Satellite Accommodation coefficient Model (SESAM) calculates the coefficient of drag, projected area,
        and force coefficient from a given set of input parameters.</p>
    <p>
        The code was developed by Marcin Pilinski and the theoretical
        framework for this is written up in his <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/912d/411295e005da3a531bf5c0fb03b749f48461.pdf">thesis</a>.
