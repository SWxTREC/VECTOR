# {{Project-Name}}

Here is where you would give a quick "elevator pitch" about your project. Who is it for, why is was it needed, what does it do, things like that.

* **Product Owner {{Organization}}:**
	{{Product Owner Name. Duplicate as necessary}} (<{{email@address.com}}>)
* **Experienced Devs:**

## Relevant JIRA Project(s)

Either a single JIRA project, or a list of JIRA projects that are relevant to this codebase. For
example, these are relevant to Lisird3:

* [LISIRDIII](http://mods-jira.lasp.colorado.edu:8080/browse/LISIRDIII/): Main project for the
	Lisird3 codebase
* [LATIS](http://mods-jira.lasp.colorado.edu:8080/browse/LATIS/): Project for the latis project,
	which provides the backend to Lisird3
* [METAREPO](http://mods-jira.lasp.colorado.edu:8080/browse/METAREPO/): Project for the LEMR
	metadata repository, which also provides data to Lisird3

## Related Projects

If this is part of the webtcad/latis family, a link to the core project is required. Here, you
should put links to other JIRA projects that this project uses. For example, if this were
Webtcad-maven, links to webtcad-core and latis would be here.

* [{{Project Name}}]({{Link To Project}})

## Production URLs

Where can you find this project in production? For example:

* Production site: https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/team/
	* NOTE: see "Necessary Permissions" for WebIAM group
* Testing site: http://sdc-webdev1.lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/team/

## Necessary Permissions

What permissions, if any, are necessary to work on this project, deploy it, or view it in
production? For example, if this page will be protected by WebIAM, what WebIAM group does a user
need to be in to be able to see the page/site? Example:

* Hudson permissions: ask Steve
* WebIAM group for production: mms-sdc-science-team

## Architecture

How is the project itself set up? Where would the code live in the big picture, what would it
communicate with? Code/directory structure, front/back-end explanations, and testing procedure would
be appropriate here. 

## Running {{Project-Name}} Locally

### Project Dependencies

For example, does the project depend on having a local apache server? Fuseki? Can this project be
run independently? As an example, webtcad-core can't exactly do much on its own.

### Special DevEnv Issues

Is there anything platform specific being run? Does it need to live inside a VM to reproduce
behaviour? Connected to a VPN/internal network?

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Run `npm run build:prod`  for a production build.

### Linting

Run `npm run lint` to lint your code, or run `npm run lint:watch` to automatically lint every time you change a file.

Automatically fix many linter warnings by running `npm run lint:fix`.

### Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).


## Deploying {{Project-Name}}

### Requirements

Who needs to be made aware of a release? What limitations/restrictions are there before making a
release? For example, is there an explicity vetting process, or perhaps certain time windows when a
release shouldn't be made?

### Process

How is the app/server/project deployed? What is the process for making a release? Many projects will
have a simple Hudson job, while others may be much more involved.

## FAQs and Help

### {{Project-Name}}-specific common issues, gotchas

Any kind of project-specific issues that would pop up goes here, as well as any quirks or
inconsistiencies within the project (e.g. hacks, workarounds, "I don't know why this works but....")
